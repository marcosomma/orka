# OrKa – Orchestrator Kit for Agentic Reasoning

**OrKa** is a modular, transparent AI cognition framework for orchestrating agent-based reasoning workflows using LLMs. Designed from the ground up for **traceability**, **modularity**, and **introspective control**, OrKa enables the construction of composable reasoning systems inspired by cognitive science — without sacrificing the power of modern foundation models.

> 💡 Built for AGI researchers, explainability advocates, and developers who need more than just chains and wrappers.

## 🧠 What is OrKa?

OrKa is a lightweight SDK and orchestration runtime for defining cognitive pipelines using YAML files and pluggable AI agents.

It shifts AI orchestration from monolithic prompting or hard-coded chains to a **distributed cognition model**, where each step is handled by a distinct reasoning agent: classifiers, validators, searchers, routers, and more.

Every step is logged, inspectable, and overrideable. OrKa doesn’t hide the process — it **lets you observe cognition as it unfolds**.

## 🔧 Core Concepts

- **Orchestrators** manage control flow between agents.
- **Agents** are stateless modules that perform tasks like:
  - Binary decision making
  - Classification
  - Web search
  - Validation
  - Routing (conditional branching)
- **Redis Streams** or (soon) Kafka enable async message passing and logging.
- **YAML configuration** defines the entire reasoning graph declaratively.

## 📦 Features

✅ Pluggable agent system  
✅ LLM-backed binary/classification/chain-of-thought agents  
✅ Conditional logic via `RouterAgent`  
✅ Google/DuckDuckGo search fallback  
✅ Full Redis-based trace logging  
✅ Kafka-ready memory layer (planned)  
✅ Compatible with local or remote LLMs (via LiteLLM)  
✅ Roadmap for visual orchestration via Tiamat-GenAI

## ✨ Why OrKa?

Unlike LangChain, CrewAI, or Flowise, OrKa is not just a wrapper for LLM APIs. It is:

- 🧱 **Modular by default** — Agents are black-box-optional, testable, and swappable.
- 🕸 **Traceable and introspectable** — Every thought path is logged.
- 🔄 **Designed for cognitive experimentation** — Emergent behaviors, agent conflict resolution, and agent memory are on the roadmap.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Check out [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for setup, installation, and your first YAML orchestration.

Want to see how it all works?  
Jump into [`orka.yaml`](../orka.yaml) and try running:

```bash
python test_run.py
````

## 🛣 Roadmap
✅ Agent routing via RouterAgent

🔜 Kafka-backed memory agent

🔜 Graph-based visualization of traces

🔜 External plugin registry for custom agents

🔜 Meta-agents (self-reflection + re-routing)

## 🤝 Collaboration & Philosophy
OrKa is an open research framework as much as it is a dev tool.
It’s built on the belief that AI cognition should be explainable, inspectable, and composable — not opaque.

This project welcomes collaboration with:

- AGI labs

- Cognitive scientists

- ML/LLM engineers

- Open-source tinkerers and thinkers
