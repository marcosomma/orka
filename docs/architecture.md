# OrKa Architecture ***(Patent Pending)***

OrKa (Orchestrator Kit for Agentic Reasoning) is built on a simple but powerful architecture: modular AI agents orchestrated through a declarative YAML interface, with messaging and traceability powered by Redis (and soon Kafka).

This document breaks down the key architectural components and how they work together.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Agents:** Pluggable units of reasoning (e.g., classifier, validator, search agent).
- **Orchestrator:** Controls the flow of data between agents.
- **Router Agent:** Conditionally modifies flow based on logic.
- **Redis Streams:** Used for async messaging and trace logging.
- **YAML Config:** Describes the orchestration graph.

                    ▼             ▼             ▼
               [Output A]    [Next Agent(s)] [Output B]
```

## 📦 Orchestrator Flow

1. Reads `orka.yaml`
2. Instantiates each agent with its type, queue, and prompt
3. Initializes the execution queue (static or routed)
4. Passes input to each agent and collects results
5. Logs each interaction in Redis using `MemoryLogger`

---

## 🔁 Message Passing

- **Queueing model:** Each agent has its own Redis channel/stream.
- **Communication:** Simple function calls + optional pub/sub abstraction.
- **Planned Kafka backend:** For durable distributed cognition.

---

## 📄 YAML-Driven Control

OrKa is fully driven by `orka.yaml`, which defines:
- Agent IDs and types
- Prompts and behavior
- Routing logic via `RouterAgent`
- Execution strategy (decision-tree, dynamic)

This allows reproducible reasoning pipelines and declarative logic.

---

## 🔍 Logging with Redis

All agent outputs are logged with metadata:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "validate_fact",
  "event_type": "output",
  "timestamp": "2024-04-12T18:00:00Z",
  "payload": {
    "input": "Was the Eiffel Tower built before 1900?",
    "result": true
  }
}
```

> You can inspect these with `xread` or `xrevrange` on the stream key `orka:memory`.

---

## 🛣 Roadmap Additions

- ✅ Dynamic routing via `RouterAgent`
- 🔜 Kafka support (stream processing + replay)
- 🔜 DAG visualization of agent flow
- 🔜 Agent plugins via Python entrypoints
- 🔜 Memory agent (stateful across runs)

---

OrKa’s architecture is intentionally minimal, observable, and composable — so you can build LLM-based cognition that doesn’t disappear into a black box.
